Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition (C-UASC) | Payload Team
This project focuses on the design, analysis, and testing of a payload release mechanism for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) developed for the Collegiate Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition (C-UASC). The goal was to create a lightweight, reliable, and competition-compliant mechanism that safely releases payloads while maintaining flight stability.

1. Design a compact payload release mechanism within strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints:
- Payload geometry: 10 × 10 × 10 cm cube
- Embedded accelerometers → impact ≤ 5 g (50 m/s²)
- Implies:
  + Controlled release height
  + Shock mitigation
  + Smooth release (no impulsive forces)
  + Secure retention until release

2. Ensure reliable release during flight without compromising UAV stability
3. Optimize center of gravity (CG) and structural integrity
4. Manufacture and test the system using rapid prototyping methods
